"Feature","Name","Unit","Source","Description"
"delta_total.energy","Folding energy ΔG","kJ/mol","FoldX5","The change in protein folding energy as a proxy for overall protein stability, computed by integrating all individual energetic contributions and expressed as Gibbs free energy change, which is equal to the sum of the enthalpy plus the product of the temperature and entropy of the system."
"delta_charge","Net electric charge at pH 7","pKa","R-Peptides","The net charge of a protein sequence based on the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation described by Moore, D. S. (1985). The net charge is calculated at pH 7 using the Lehninger pKa scale."
"delta_hydrophobicMoment","Hydrophobic moment","μH","R-Peptides","The amphipathic character of a peptide or protein region by summing the vector contribution of sidechain hydrophobicities. Computed with protein rotational angle of 100 degrees with a sequence fraction length of 11 amino acids."
"delta_hydrophobicity","Hydrophobicity","GRAVY","R-Peptides","The relative affinity of a side chain or molecule for non-polar (hydrophobic) versus polar (aqueous) environments. Computed on the Kyte-Doolittle scale."
"delta_isoElecPoint","Isoelectric point","pH","R-Peptides","The pH at which the protein carries no net electrical charge. Computed on the EMBOSS pK scale."
"delta_ligand_nr_of_predicted_pockets","Ligand binding","pockets","P2Rank","Total number of potential binding pockets"
"delta_ligand_rank1_sas_points","Ligand binding pocket","SAS points","P2Rank","Top ranked ligand binding pocket"
